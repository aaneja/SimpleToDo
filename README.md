# Pre-work - *SimpleToDo*

**SimpleToDo** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Anant Aneja**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [x] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [ ] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [ ] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [ ] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

#### Environment setup related:

 * I wanted to develop in Linux exclusively. Setting u up a Ubunutu Hyper-V VM + Windows X server install + Android Studio took a non-trivial amount of time! It seems to be worth the effort though, no PATH related foo-bars!
 * For testing/debugging: Hyper-V does not passthrough processor virt features to guest OS'es; so Android Studio complained about not having support to setup a fast emulator. I ended up using a real Android device + using ADB over the network (ADB over network support is pretty cool!)
